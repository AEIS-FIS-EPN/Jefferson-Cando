# Portfolio Overview

Welcome to my portfolio! This portfolio showcases my skills and projects in both frontend and backend development.

## Frontend

The frontend of this portfolio provides information about me, my experiences, and my areas of expertise. It is built using React.js and styled with CSS to create a clean and responsive user interface.

## Backend

The backend of this portfolio, built with Python, serves as the backend service accessed by the frontend to utilize the machine learning model. It handles requests from the frontend and processes data to provide insights or perform actions based on the user's interactions.

## Future Developments

For future advancements, the goal is to directly load the machine learning model into the browser or frontend. This will enhance performance and reduce reliance on backend services, providing a smoother user experience.
